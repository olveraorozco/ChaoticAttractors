# ChaoticAttractors
Coding and visualizing chaotic attractors using C, Fortran and gnuplot

This repo will contain a series of codes where chaotic attractors are solved, some using Euler's method, Runge-Kutta, or more methods that come up with as I continue working on them. Plotting isn't much of an issue since it's a one liner on gnuplot, yet it will be described exactly what to type. 

I've been compiling with Intel's Compiler, and I've noticed that some don't work as well when compiled with the GNU Compiler Collection. I will be specifying all of this as well as corrections.
