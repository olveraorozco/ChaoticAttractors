# Lorentz Oscillator

In this folder you can find several files which are pretty self explanatory. 
  
"example_output.pdf" shows the output of the Lorentz Oscillator after the trajectory has finished. For this case I have used a single point and plotted it with a black line.
  
 "lorentz_compile_instructions.txt" explains how to use *gnuplot* to view the oscillator with two approaches:
  
  1. "simplified" 
  2. "fancy"
  
 "lorentz_main.c" is the main C code. It is commented throughout and is ready to be compiled using the file above.
 
 "anim.gp" is the *gnuplot* code to produce an animation of the Lorentz Oscillator.
 
 "animated_lorentz_oscillator.gif" is a low quality GIF that I created to show the output of a very basic *gnuplot* way to follow two trajectories and plot their paths as they reach the maximum time. This is created using the file directly above (lorentz_main.c). I will be uploading a more appealing way to visualize their trajectories. For this purpose I have uploaded two example output files that downloaded and used with *anim.gp* should work right away.
