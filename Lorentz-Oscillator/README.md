# Lorentz Oscillator

In this folder you can find several files which are pretty self explanatory. 
  
__example_output.pdf__ shows the output of the Lorentz Oscillator after the trajectory has finished. For this case I have used a single point and plotted it with a black line.
  
  __lorentz_compile_instructions.txt__ explain how to use *gnuplot* to view the oscillator with two approaches:
  1. "simplified" 
  2. "fancy"
